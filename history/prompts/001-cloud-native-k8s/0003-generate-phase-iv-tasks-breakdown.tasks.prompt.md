## Prompt

/sp.tasks

Generate actionable task breakdown for Phase IV cloud-native Kubernetes deployment based on specification and implementation plan.

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task breakdown with 100 tasks organized by user story priority for Phase IV cloud-native deployment.

**Task Organization**:

1. **Phase 1: Setup (Infrastructure Foundation)** - 3 tasks
   - Create infra directory structure
   - Create .dockerignore files for frontend and backend
   - No story labels (foundational setup)

2. **Phase 2: Foundational (Minikube Environment)** - 4 tasks
   - Create Minikube setup, deployment, and cleanup scripts
   - Document prerequisites
   - CRITICAL: Blocks all Kubernetes deployment work
   - No story labels (blocking prerequisites)

3. **Phase 3: User Story 1 - Application Containerization (P1)** - 9 tasks (T008-T016)
   - Generate Dockerfiles (multi-stage frontend, backend)
   - Create Nginx configuration
   - Build and test container images
   - Verify Phase III functionality in containers
   - Optimize image sizes
   - All tasks labeled [US1]
   - Independent test: docker run locally

4. **Phase 4: User Story 2 - Kubernetes Deployment Package (P2)** - 30 tasks (T017-T046)
   - Create Helm chart structure (Chart.yaml, values.yaml, helpers)
   - Generate 7 Kubernetes resource templates (deployments, services, ingress, secret, configmap)
   - Add probes, resource limits, rolling update strategy
   - Validate and deploy to Minikube
   - Test complete user flow in Kubernetes
   - All tasks labeled [US2]
   - Independent test: helm install, access via http://todo.local

5. **Phase 5: User Story 3 - AI-Powered DevOps Operations (P3)** - 20 tasks (T047-T066)
   - Document and test Gordon (Docker AI) integration
   - Document and test kubectl-ai operations (scale, debug, logs)
   - Document and test kagent analysis (health, optimization)
   - Create comprehensive demo script
   - Simulate failures and demonstrate recovery
   - All tasks labeled [US3]
   - Independent test: Execute AI tool commands, verify functionality

6. **Phase 6: User Story 4 - Observability and Demo Readiness (P4)** - 28 tasks (T067-T094)
   - Verify structured logging and health endpoints
   - Create comprehensive documentation (README, troubleshooting, architecture)
   - Prepare judge-friendly demo presentation
   - Practice complete demo flow (<15 minutes)
   - Final validation against all success criteria
   - All tasks labeled [US4]
   - Independent test: Run complete demo script end-to-end

7. **Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns** - 6 tasks (T095-T100)
   - Create environment-specific values files
   - Add production recommendations and HPA stubs
   - Final end-to-end validation
   - No story labels (affects multiple stories)

**Task Format Compliance**:
- ✅ All 100 tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- ✅ Sequential IDs (T001-T100)
- ✅ [P] markers for 35 parallelizable tasks
- ✅ [Story] labels (US1-US4) for all user story tasks
- ✅ Exact file paths included in descriptions
- ✅ Clear dependencies documented

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- Setup: 2 tasks can run in parallel (T002, T003)
- Foundational: 2 tasks can run in parallel (T005, T006)
- US1: 2 tasks can run in parallel (T008, T009 - Dockerfiles)
- US2: 10 tasks can run in parallel (T017-T019 Helm structure, T020-T026 templates)
- US3: 6 tasks can run in parallel (documentation tasks)
- US4: 10 tasks can run in parallel (observability and documentation)
- Polish: 4 tasks can run in parallel (T095-T098)

**Dependencies**:
- Setup → Foundational (Minikube scripts need directory structure)
- Setup → US1 (Dockerfiles need directory structure)
- Foundational + US1 → US2 (Helm deployment needs Minikube + containers)
- US2 → US3 (AI tools need deployed application)
- US2 → US4 (Observability needs deployed application)
- All stories → Polish (final improvements)

**Independent Testing**:
- US1: Test with docker run locally (no Kubernetes needed)
- US2: Test with fresh Minikube + helm install
- US3: Test AI tools with deployed application
- US4: Test complete demo script end-to-end

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (9 tasks) - Containerization can be validated independently with docker run

**Implementation Strategy**:
- MVP First: Complete US1, validate containers locally
- Incremental: Add US2 (K8s deployment), then US3 (AI tools), then US4 (demo polish)
- Parallel Team: US1 can proceed independently, US2 waits for US1 containers, US3/US4 wait for US2 deployment

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated production-ready task breakdown with 100 actionable tasks organized by user story priority. All tasks follow strict checklist format with IDs, parallel markers, story labels, and file paths. Clear dependencies and parallel opportunities identified. Ready for implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests requested in specification - focusing on infrastructure validation
- 📁 Files: Created 1 file (tasks.md with 100 tasks across 7 phases)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin automated execution, or review tasks.md before implementation, or /sp.git.commit_pr to commit all Phase IV planning artifacts
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown successfully maps all 36 functional requirements from spec.md to concrete implementation tasks. Four user stories cleanly separated into independent phases. Each story has clear independent test criteria. Parallel opportunities maximize efficiency (35 parallelizable tasks). MVP scope clearly defined (US1 only, 9 tasks). All tasks include exact file paths for clarity. Dependencies properly documented to prevent blocking. Format validation confirms all 100 tasks follow checklist standard.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation - PASS (all 100 tasks follow checklist format with IDs, markers, labels, paths)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement to execute tasks, starting with Setup and Foundational phases, then US1 containerization
