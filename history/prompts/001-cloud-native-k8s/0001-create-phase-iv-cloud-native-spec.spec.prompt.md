## Prompt

/sp.specify Phase IV – Cloud-Native Todo AI Chatbot (Local Kubernetes Deployment with AI-Powered DevOps)

Target audience: Hackathon judges evaluating advanced cloud-native maturity, intelligent DevOps automation, seamless evolution from Phase III, and effective use of AI tools (Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent) in infrastructure
End-users: Developers / demo viewers who want to see the full Todo AI Chatbot running resiliently on Kubernetes locally

Focus:
Transform the existing Phase III full-stack Todo AI Chatbot (Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend + Cohere-powered agent) into a production-grade, cloud-native application deployed locally on Minikube using AI-assisted containerization, Helm packaging, and Kubernetes operations. Emphasize spec-driven infrastructure automation, heavy reliance on Docker Gordon (AI agent), kubectl-ai, and kagent for intelligent deployment, scaling, debugging, and optimization.

Success criteria:
- Frontend and backend fully containerized with perfect, production-ready Dockerfiles (generated or assisted by Gordon)
- Helm chart created for the entire application (single helm install deploys frontend, backend, services, ingress)
- Minikube cluster successfully starts and runs the full app with Ingress access (e.g., http://todo.local)
- All AI DevOps tools used meaningfully: Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent
- Application remains 100% functional inside Kubernetes: auth, task CRUD, Cohere chatbot, user profile queries
- Observability: Pods healthy, logs accessible, kubectl-ai can explain failures/optimizations
- Demo flow impressive: "Watch AI deploy, scale, and fix the app live"
- Judges confirm: "True cloud-native upgrade – spec-driven infra, AI-powered DevOps, zero manual YAML hell"

Constraints:
- Deployment environment: Local Minikube only (no cloud clusters, no EKS/GKE)
- Use Gordon (Docker AI Agent) whenever possible (Docker Desktop 4.53+ Beta enabled)
- Fallback: If Gordon unavailable, Claude Code must generate flawless Dockerfiles + docker build/push commands
- Helm charts: Generate via Claude Code or kubectl-ai – no manual helm create/install
- Database: Prefer external Neon (as in Phase III), or add local PostgreSQL pod if full local isolation needed
- Ingress: Use Minikube ingress addon + host mapping (todo.local → 127.0.0.1)
- Secrets: JWT secret, COHERE_API_KEY, DB URL injected via Kubernetes Secrets
- No changes to existing Phase III application code – only add infra layer
- Keep frontend/backend ports standard (3000 → frontend service, 8000 → backend service)
- Resource requests/limits sensible for local Minikube (no over-provisioning)
- No CI/CD pipelines or ArgoCD (focus on local helm + AI tools)

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive Phase IV specification for cloud-native Kubernetes deployment with AI-powered DevOps automation.

**Branch Created**: `001-cloud-native-k8s`

**Specification Structure**:

1. **Four Prioritized User Stories**:
   - **P1 - Application Containerization**: Package frontend/backend as container images (foundational requirement)
   - **P2 - Kubernetes Deployment Package**: Create Helm chart for single-command deployment
   - **P3 - AI-Powered DevOps Operations**: Demonstrate Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent in action
   - **P4 - Observability and Demo Readiness**: Polish for impressive judge presentation

2. **36 Functional Requirements** organized by category:
   - Containerization (FR-001 to FR-007): Multi-stage builds, health checks, non-root users, env vars
   - Kubernetes Deployment (FR-008 to FR-016): Helm chart, deployments, services, ingress, secrets, probes
   - Application Functionality (FR-017 to FR-023): 100% Phase III parity, user isolation, JWT auth
   - AI DevOps Tools (FR-024 to FR-027): Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent integration
   - Observability (FR-028 to FR-031): Logs, health checks, events, resource monitoring
   - Deployment Environment (FR-032 to FR-036): Minikube requirements, one-command deployment

3. **15 Success Criteria** - all measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - Build times (under 5 minutes per image)
   - Deployment speed (under 3 minutes for full stack)
   - Pod startup (Running state within 2 minutes)
   - Application access (browser ready in 30 seconds)
   - Complete user flow validation
   - AI tools demonstration (3+ operations each)
   - Cluster health score (85+)
   - Demo execution (under 15 minutes)
   - Judge "wow factor" confirmation

4. **Key Entities**: Container Image, Helm Chart, Kubernetes Deployment, Service, Ingress, Secret, Pod, Minikube Cluster

5. **Edge Cases**: 10 scenarios covering resource exhaustion, connection failures, pod crashes, API issues, configuration problems

6. **Assumptions**: Documented reasonable defaults (Gordon available with fallback, kubectl-ai/kagent installed, Minikube 4GB/2CPU, external Neon DB, Phase III code stable)

7. **Out of Scope**: Clear boundaries excluding cloud deployments, advanced observability, autoscaling, CI/CD, service mesh, production migrations

**Quality Validation**:
- ✅ All checklist items passed
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all decisions made with reasonable defaults)
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ User stories independently testable
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded

**Specification Highlights**:
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no implementation details)
- Business-friendly language describing user needs and outcomes
- Progressive complexity: P1 (foundation) → P2 (deployment) → P3 (AI showcase) → P4 (demo polish)
- Each user story delivers independent value and can be tested standalone
- Clear path from Phase III (full-stack app) to Phase IV (cloud-native deployment)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive Phase IV specification defining cloud-native transformation with AI-powered DevOps automation. Specification ready for planning phase.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (specification artifact)
- 📁 Files: Created 2 files (spec.md with 36 requirements + 15 success criteria, requirements.md checklist with validation results)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan, /sp.tasks to generate actionable tasks, /sp.implement to execute deployment
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances technical depth with business clarity. Four-tier priority structure (P1-P4) enables incremental delivery. All success criteria are demo-friendly and judge-focused. AI DevOps tools (Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent) integrated as first-class requirements, not afterthoughts. Clear continuity from Phase III with zero application code changes required.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification quality checklist - PASS (all items validated successfully)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan phase to design implementation approach for containerization, Helm chart generation, and AI DevOps tool integration
