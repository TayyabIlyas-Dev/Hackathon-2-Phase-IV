## Prompt

/sp.plan Implementation Plan for Phase IV – Cloud-Native Todo AI Chatbot (Local Kubernetes Deployment with AI-Powered DevOps)

Create detailed infrastructure architecture, production-grade Dockerfiles, complete Helm chart structure, Minikube setup scripts, Kubernetes Secrets/ConfigMaps, AI DevOps workflow documentation, and demo script.

Key decisions documented: Containerization tool (Gordon vs manual), database strategy (external Neon vs local PostgreSQL), Helm chart complexity, ingress configuration (todo.local), resource requests/limits, secrets management, AI tool layering.

Testing strategy: Container build tests, Minikube health checks, Helm install validation, ingress access verification, AI tool demonstrations, end-to-end user flow, failure simulation.

Technical details: Multi-stage Dockerfiles (Node→Nginx for frontend, Python slim for backend), Helm values with external DB URL, Minikube with ingress addon, Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data, documented AI prompts.

Organized by phases: Foundation (Containerization) → Minikube Setup → Helm Chart Generation → Secrets & Config Injection → Deployment & Verification → AI DevOps Showcase → Polish & Final Review.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive implementation plan for Phase IV cloud-native Kubernetes deployment with AI-powered DevOps automation.

**Plan Structure**:

1. **Technical Context** - Complete infrastructure stack definition:
   - Languages: Node.js 18+, Python 3.11+, Bash scripting
   - Dependencies: Docker 24+, Gordon AI, Kubernetes 1.28+, Helm 3.12+, Minikube 1.32+, kubectl-ai, kagent
   - Storage: External Neon PostgreSQL, Kubernetes Secrets
   - Testing: Container validation, K8s validation, end-to-end browser testing
   - Performance goals: <5min builds, <3min deployment, <2min pod startup

2. **Constitution Check** - All 16 principles validated:
   - ✅ All core principles (I-VI) pass
   - ✅ All AI-specific requirements (VII-X) pass
   - ✅ All cloud-native requirements (XI-XVI) pass
   - No violations requiring justification

3. **Phase 0: Research & Technology Decisions** - 7 key decisions documented:
   - **Containerization**: Gordon (primary) with Claude-generated Dockerfile fallback
   - **Database**: Keep external Neon (no migration, simpler, less resources)
   - **Helm Chart**: Basic + probes + resource limits (production-ready, not over-engineered)
   - **Ingress**: todo.local with /etc/hosts mapping (production-like)
   - **Resources**: Conservative for Minikube (256Mi/200m frontend, 512Mi/300m backend)
   - **Secrets**: Kubernetes Secrets (secure, best practice)
   - **AI Tools**: Gordon → kubectl-ai → kagent (logical workflow progression)

4. **Phase 1: Infrastructure Design & Contracts**:
   - **Container Images**: todo-frontend:v1.0.0 (<100MB), todo-backend:v1.0.0 (<200MB)
   - **Helm Chart**: Chart.yaml, values.yaml, 8 templates (deployment, service, ingress, secret, configmap, helpers)
   - **Kubernetes Resources**: 2 deployments, 2 services, 1 ingress, 1 secret, 1 configmap
   - **Dockerfile Contracts**: Complete multi-stage frontend, single-stage backend with health checks
   - **Helm Values Schema**: Documented structure with all configuration parameters
   - **Quickstart Guide**: One-command deployment from prerequisites to running application

5. **Implementation Phases** - 7 phases defined:
   - Phase 1: Foundation - Containerization (Dockerfiles, build, test)
   - Phase 2: Minikube Setup (cluster start, addons, /etc/hosts)
   - Phase 3: Helm Chart Generation (templates, values, helpers)
   - Phase 4: Secrets & Config Injection (secure configuration)
   - Phase 5: Deployment & Verification (helm install, testing)
   - Phase 6: AI DevOps Showcase (Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent demos)
   - Phase 7: Polish & Final Review (documentation, demo prep)

6. **Risk Analysis**:
   - High risk: Gordon unavailable, Minikube resource exhaustion, ingress issues
   - Medium risk: Image build failures, pod crashes, secrets not injected
   - Low risk: AI tools not installed, slow startup, demo timing
   - All risks have documented mitigation strategies

**Key Artifacts Defined**:
- Infrastructure directory structure (/infra/docker, /infra/helm, /infra/scripts)
- Complete Dockerfile specifications with health checks and non-root users
- Helm values schema with frontend/backend configuration
- Quickstart guide with 8-step deployment process
- AI DevOps demo commands for Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent

**Success Criteria Alignment**:
- All 15 success criteria from spec.md mapped to implementation phases
- Each phase has clear goals and validation criteria
- Constitution compliance verified at every level

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created production-ready implementation plan for Phase IV cloud-native deployment. All technology decisions documented with rationale. Complete infrastructure design with contracts and quickstart guide. Ready for task generation and implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (planning artifact)
- 📁 Files: Created 1 file (plan.md with 740+ lines covering research, design, contracts, phases, risks)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate actionable task breakdown, /sp.implement to execute implementation, validate against success criteria
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan successfully balances technical depth with practical implementation guidance. Seven-phase structure provides clear progression from containerization to demo readiness. All constitution principles validated. Technology decisions well-reasoned with alternatives considered. Dockerfile and Helm contracts provide clear implementation targets. Quickstart guide enables one-command deployment. Risk analysis comprehensive with mitigation strategies. AI DevOps tools integrated throughout workflow, not as afterthought.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution check - PASS (all 16 principles satisfied)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks to generate detailed task breakdown, then /sp.implement to execute containerization and Helm chart generation
