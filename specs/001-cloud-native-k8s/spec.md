# Feature Specification: Cloud-Native Kubernetes Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `001-cloud-native-k8s`
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase IV – Cloud-Native Todo AI Chatbot (Local Kubernetes Deployment with AI-Powered DevOps)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Application Containerization (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need the existing Todo AI Chatbot application (frontend and backend) packaged as container images so that they can run consistently in any container orchestration environment.

**Why this priority**: Containerization is the foundational requirement for cloud-native deployment. Without container images, no Kubernetes deployment is possible. This is the critical first step that enables all subsequent infrastructure work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by building container images locally, running them with docker run, and verifying the application responds correctly on expected ports (frontend on 3000, backend on 8000) with all features functional (authentication, task CRUD, AI chatbot).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Phase III application codebase exists, **When** container images are built for frontend and backend, **Then** both images build successfully without errors and are tagged with semantic versions
2. **Given** frontend container image is built, **When** the container is run locally with required environment variables, **Then** the Next.js application serves on port 3000 and all pages render correctly
3. **Given** backend container image is built, **When** the container is run locally with database connection and API keys, **Then** the FastAPI application serves on port 8000 and all API endpoints respond correctly
4. **Given** both containers are running, **When** a user accesses the frontend and performs authentication, task operations, and AI chat, **Then** all functionality works identically to Phase III local development
5. **Given** containers are running, **When** health check endpoints are queried, **Then** both containers return healthy status with detailed information

---

### User Story 2 - Kubernetes Deployment Package (Priority: P2)

As a deployment engineer, I need a complete Kubernetes deployment package (Helm chart) that can deploy the entire Todo AI Chatbot application to a local Kubernetes cluster with a single command.

**Why this priority**: Once containers exist, the next critical step is packaging them for Kubernetes deployment. The Helm chart provides declarative infrastructure configuration and enables repeatable, version-controlled deployments. This is essential for demonstrating cloud-native maturity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a fresh Minikube cluster, running helm install with the chart, and verifying all pods reach Running state, services are created, ingress is configured, and the application is accessible via the configured hostname (e.g., http://todo.local).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Minikube cluster is running, **When** the Helm chart is installed with default values, **Then** all Kubernetes resources are created (deployments, services, ingress, secrets, configmaps) without errors
2. **Given** the Helm chart is installed, **When** checking pod status, **Then** frontend pods (minimum 2 replicas) and backend pods (minimum 2 replicas) are all in Running state with 0 restarts
3. **Given** the Helm chart is installed, **When** querying services, **Then** frontend service and backend service are created with correct port mappings and endpoints
4. **Given** the Helm chart is installed with ingress enabled, **When** accessing the configured hostname, **Then** the application loads in a browser and all functionality works
5. **Given** the Helm chart is installed, **When** secrets are examined, **Then** JWT secret, Cohere API key, and database URL are properly injected as environment variables (not visible in logs)
6. **Given** the Helm chart is installed, **When** resource limits are checked, **Then** all pods have appropriate CPU and memory requests/limits defined
7. **Given** the application is running in Kubernetes, **When** a pod is deleted, **Then** Kubernetes automatically recreates it and the application remains available

### User Story 3 - AI-Powered DevOps Operations (Priority: P3)

As a DevOps engineer, I need to use AI-powered tools (Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent) to intelligently build containers, deploy to Kubernetes, scale applications, and diagnose issues without writing manual commands.

**Why this priority**: This is the differentiating factor that makes Phase IV impressive. AI DevOps tools demonstrate cutting-edge automation and intelligent operations. While not strictly required for basic deployment, this showcases advanced capabilities and makes the demo memorable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by demonstrating each AI tool performing its intended function: Gordon building optimized container images, kubectl-ai generating and executing Kubernetes operations via natural language, and kagent analyzing cluster health and providing optimization recommendations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docker Desktop with Gordon enabled is available, **When** Gordon is asked to build container images, **Then** it generates optimized Dockerfiles and builds images with intelligent layer caching and size optimization
2. **Given** kubectl-ai is installed, **When** asked to "deploy todo-backend with 3 replicas and 500m CPU limit", **Then** it generates and applies the correct Kubernetes deployment manifest
3. **Given** kubectl-ai is installed, **When** asked to "scale frontend to 5 replicas", **Then** it executes the scaling operation and confirms the new replica count
4. **Given** a pod is in CrashLoopBackOff state, **When** kubectl-ai is asked to "check why backend pod is failing", **Then** it analyzes logs, events, and configuration to provide root cause analysis
5. **Given** kagent is installed, **When** asked to "analyze cluster health", **Then** it provides a comprehensive health report with scores, warnings, and recommendations
6. **Given** kagent is installed, **When** asked to "optimize resource allocation for todo pods", **Then** it analyzes actual resource usage and suggests right-sized requests/limits
7. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** kubectl-ai is asked to "show logs for backend pods", **Then** it retrieves and displays logs with intelligent filtering

---

### User Story 4 - Observability and Demo Readiness (Priority: P4)

As a hackathon presenter, I need comprehensive observability (logs, health checks, metrics) and a polished demo script that showcases the cloud-native deployment and AI DevOps tools in an impressive, judge-friendly way.

**Why this priority**: This is the final polish that makes the demo impressive and ensures judges can see the full value. While the application can function without perfect observability, this is what separates a working deployment from a "wow factor" presentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running through the complete demo script from start to finish, verifying all commands work, all AI tools respond correctly, logs are accessible, health checks pass, and the end-to-end user flow (signup → login → chat → tasks) works flawlessly in Kubernetes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** checking pod logs, **Then** all pods emit structured logs to stdout/stderr that are easily readable and contain relevant information
2. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** health check endpoints are queried, **Then** they return detailed status including database connectivity, API availability, and service health
3. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** Kubernetes events are examined, **Then** no error events are present and all scheduling/startup events show success
4. **Given** the demo script is followed, **When** executing each step, **Then** all commands complete successfully and produce expected output
5. **Given** a fresh Minikube cluster, **When** following the one-command deployment instructions from README, **Then** the entire application deploys successfully within 5 minutes
6. **Given** the application is running in Kubernetes, **When** performing the complete user flow (signup → login → create tasks → chat with AI → view profile), **Then** all features work identically to Phase III with no degradation
7. **Given** kagent is used during demo, **When** it analyzes the cluster, **Then** it reports healthy status with no critical issues and provides impressive optimization insights
